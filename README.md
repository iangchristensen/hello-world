# Project Name: hello-world

## Description
This project's purpose was to learn how to start using GitHub by creating my first repository. This README file is my first attempt to follow the recommended [formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) for a README while also utilizing and demonstrating the use of GitHub [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). I'll be using decreasing sizes of headers for each of the formatting sections, an ordered list for the table of contents, a blockquote for the contributing section, a link for the contributing, credits, and license sections.

#### Installation
To install this project simply download the zip file or clone the repository. It's not in any specific language and doesn't need to be compiled. Consider including a GIF.

##### Usage
Using this project is super simple. All you can do is open it with a texteditor. There aren't special console commands or specific things the project can be used on. Include an image of the project working (Check the [formatting guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to figure out how to do this).

###### Contributing
> Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for [setting guidelines for repository contributors](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).
